/**
 * A lock-free byte array allocator with optional pooling to reduce GC pressure.
 *
 * <p>Designed for use by a single HTTP/2 connection. Each connection should have
 * its own allocator to minimize contention.
 *
 * <p>Implementation details:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Bounded, array-backed LIFO stack (no queue nodes).</li>
 *   <li>Single AtomicInteger "top" index, used as the size and stack pointer.</li>
 *   <li>Best-effort: under races we may drop or miss a buffer instead of pooling
 *       it, which is fine for a GC-reducing pool.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The allocator has a configurable maximum count and poolable size. Buffers larger
 * than {@code maxPoolableSize} are never pooled. Requests larger than
 * {@code maxBufferSize} are rejected.
 *
 * <p>Thread-safe: multiple threads can borrow and release buffers concurrently.

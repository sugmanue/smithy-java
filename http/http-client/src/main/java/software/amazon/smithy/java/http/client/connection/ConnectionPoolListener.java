/**
 * Listener for connection pool lifecycle events.
 *
 * <p>Implement this interface to monitor connection pool activity for metrics collection, leak detection, logging,
 * etc. All methods have empty default implementations, so you only need to override the events you care about.
 * Listeners are called synchronously on the thread performing the pool operation. Implementations should be fast
 * and non-blocking to avoid impacting pool performance.
 *
 * <h2>Important: Do not modify connections</h2>
 * <p>Listeners receive connection references for identification and metadata access only. Do NOT call
 * {@link HttpConnection#close()}, {@link HttpConnection#newExchange}, or hold strong references to connections.
 *
 * <h2>Connection Lifecycle</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * New connection with successful use: onConnected → onAcquire(reused=false) → use → onReturn → (pooled, no close)
 * New connection, pool full on return: onConnected → onAcquire(reused=false) → use → onReturn → onClosed
 * Reused connection: onAcquire(reused=true) → use → onReturn → (pooled, no close)
 * Connection with error: onAcquire → use → onClosed  (no onReturn, user evicted)
 * Idle connection expires: (in pool) → onClosed
 * Pool shutdown: (in pool) → onClosed
 * }</pre>

# Change Log

## 1.7.0 (9/30/2026)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All client modules are considered stable.  Some modules, including
> server, CLI, and MCP, are still in developer-preview and may contain
> bugs.  No guarantee is made about their API stability. Unstable
> modules are marked with a warning in their `README.md` and with the
> `@SmithyUnstableApi` annotation in their `package-info.java`.

### Features

* Added support for `oneOf` defaults when a discriminator is missing, along
  with a validator for the default target.
  ([#1376](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1376))
* Made the Smithy serde provider the default for the XML and JSON codecs,
  removing the need for extra configuration to opt into it.
  ([#1372](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1372))
* Added modern MCP protocol conformance to the MCP server, including
  protocol version negotiation and conformance test coverage.
  ([#1341](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1341))

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed the MCP server returning stale tools and prompts after a
  `list_changed` notification.
  ([#1377](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1377))
* Fixed the member name cache producing incorrect results when serializing a
  document wrapping a structure.
  ([#1372](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1372))
* Fixed several identity and authentication resolution issues, skipping
  endpoint auth schemes incompatible with the resolved auth scheme, removing
  duplicate auth schemes, and checking the resolver before reading auth
  properties.
  ([#1370](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1370))
* Fixed the MCP server failing to list tools when a `oneOf` document appeared
  as an operation input or output root, which previously threw a
  `ClassCastException` or silently dropped the `oneOf` variants depending on
  schema build order.
  ([#1345](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1345))
* Fixed generated structure serializers emitting members in declaration order
  instead of schema order.
  ([#1344](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1344))

### Improvements

* Improved base64 encoding performance by reusing a scratch buffer instead of
  allocating per call.
  ([#1363](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1363))
* Improved generated map serialization by using `Map.forEach` to avoid
  per-entry view allocations.
  ([#1362](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1362))
* Improved HTTP header value normalization performance.
  ([#1351](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1351))
* Improved AWS Query string encoding performance.
  ([#1350](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1350))
* Improved base64 encoding performance for exact-length arrays.
  ([#1349](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1349))

  ([#1336](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1336))

### Bug Fixes

  strings, arbitrary-length `BigInteger` values, nested collection indexes,
  and pooled serializer reuse.
  ([#1343](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1343))
* Fixed GZIP request compression appending unused buffer capacity as trailing
  zero bytes.
  ([#1342](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1342))
* Fixed MCP `tools/list` and `prompts/list` pagination and made tool, prompt,
  and proxy registries thread-safe to prevent `tools/list_changed` refresh
  deadlocks.
  ([#1336](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1336))
* Fixed unknown MCP JSON-RPC methods returning an empty response instead of a
  `-32601` method-not-found error.
  ([#1338](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1338))

### Improvements

* Improved Query serialization performance for mixed Unicode strings and
  oversized buffers.
  ([#1343](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1343))
* Improved MCP registry safety by returning immutable proxy snapshots and
  preserving deterministic tool and prompt insertion order.
  ([#1336](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1336))

  operations to be invoked without code generation.
  ([#1328](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1328))

  `@auth` overrides, `@auth([])`, and `@optionalAuth` so that auth resolution
  matches a code-generated client.
  ([#1328](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1328))

  name matching, faster JSON string scanning, reading whole-number doubles
  without the floating-point parser, and parsing ten-digit epoch seconds with a
  single word compare.

### Features

* Added config settings to customize the input and output suffixes
  ([#1309](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1309))
* Updated credential chains to adhere to the refresh SEP
  ([#1302](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1302))
* Added `ShapeTranscoder` for transcoding a shape directly into another shape.
  ([#1299](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1299))
* Added a modular AWS credential chain with pluggable provider discovery.
  ([#1172](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1172))

  ([#1246](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1246))
* Updated timestamp deserialization for dynamic to be more protocol agnostic.
  ([#1258](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1258))
* Added the ability to trace a BDD evaluation and gave the rules engine
  the ability to set the input params to a context key.
  ([#1259](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1259))
* Added an S3 plugin that removes the bucket from the path of an operation
  if the operation gets the path from the rules engine.
  ([#1259](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1259))

  HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2 bidirectional streaming.
  ([#1278](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1278))

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed MCP `tools/list` and `prompts/list` pagination to follow `nextCursor`.
  ([#1308](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1308))
* Updated RPC protocol events to always serialize an empty payload with a
  content-type for events with no payload members.
  ([#1245](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1245))
* Fixed a bug where CBOR floats and doubles were rejecting integer-encoded
  values. ([#1247](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1247))

  ([#1261](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1261))
* Updated auth to explicitly deny authorization and transfer-encoding headers
  from appearing in a canonical string to sign in case a mutable request is
  reused after signing. Authorization is needed to exclude it from the signature
  when resigned, and transfer-encoding is another addition to keep transient
  headers out of the signed request.
  ([#1268](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1268))

* Fixed jitter to exclude zero, ensuring a non-zero backoff delay.
  ([#1300](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1300))

### Improvements

* Introduced an optimized, StAX-free XML Codec implementation, currently gated 
  behind `Builder.useNative(true)` or `-Dsmithy-java.xml-provider=smithy`
  ([#1231](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1231)).
* Improved HTTP serializer by avoiding eager allocations for HTTP payloads.
  ([#1238](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1238))
* Reduced the number of allocations needed for dynamic schemas, particularly
  for union-dense payloads (e.g. DynamoDB AttributeValue) and string/enum lists.
  ([#1255](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-java/pull/1255))
